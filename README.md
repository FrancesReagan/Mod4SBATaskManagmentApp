My Task Management App 📝
This is my first task management app project - a simple task management application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
It allows users to create, track, and organize their tasks in one place.

Features I've Implemented
•	📋 Task Creation: Add new tasks with name, category, deadline, and status
•	🔄 Task Status Updates: Change task status directly from the list view
•	🗑️ Task Deletion: Remove tasks you no longer need
•	🏷️ Task Categories: Organize tasks into Work, Personal, Study, Health, or Other categories
•	📊 Status Tracking: Track whether tasks are Not Started, In Progress, Completed, or Overdue
•	📅 Deadline Management: Set deadlines and auto-detect overdue tasks
•	🔍 Filtering: Filter tasks by status or category to focus on what's important
•	💾 Local Storage: Tasks are saved in your browser so they persist between sessions
•	📱 Responsive Design: Looks good on both desktop and mobile devices

How to Use

Setting Up
1.	Download all three files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
2.	Make sure they're all in the same folder
3.	Open index.html in your browser
No server or installation needed

Adding Tasks

o	Enter a task name
o	Select a category
o	Choose a deadline
o	Set the initial status

2.	Click "Add Task"
Managing Your Tasks
•	Change Status: Use the dropdown in the task list to update a task's status
•	Delete Tasks: Click the "Delete" button to remove a task
•	Filter Tasks: Use the filter dropdowns to show only specific tasks
•	Overdue Detection: Tasks past their deadline are automatically marked as overdue when you load the app

What I Learned
Building this task management app taught me:
•	How to work with the DOM to create dynamic web content
•	Using localStorage to save data in the browser
•	Creating and styling forms with CSS
•	Building responsive layouts with Flexbox
•	Implementing filtering functionality
•	Working with JavaScript date objects
•	Creating and handling events

Future Improvements
I'd like to add these features as I continue learning:
•	Task editing
•	Search functionality
•	Sorting options (by name, deadline, etc.)
•	Task priority levels
•	Dark/light mode toggle
•	Drag-and-drop task reordering
•	Export/import functionality
•	Browser notifications for upcoming deadlines

My Coding Journey
App built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. If you have any suggestions or feedback, I'd love to hear them.
Happy task managing 😊
